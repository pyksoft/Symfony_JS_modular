gear
====

#### An endless possibilities front-end framework is coming... stay tuned !
> Note : gear will be released in a few weeks. It is still under intensive development, so we don't recommend using it for now.

# Getting started
## Download
gear comes in two versions : 
* A production version, to set up and work with in a minute,
* A development version, containing all source files for total control.
Just [visit the download page](http://emaj-fr.github.io/gear/#/getting-started), or clone/download this repository !

## Installation
Dead simple : drop the gear folder content inside your project, and insert these two lines :
```
<!-- VIEWPORT FOR RESPONSIVE -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<!-- GEAR -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/gear.css">

```

# Documentation
An online documentation is available at http://emaj-fr.github.io/gear/#/doc

# Using Scss
If you downloaded the development version of gear (and we're happy you did so), you will need a Sass compiler to get your css files.
You can use [Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) or [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/).
